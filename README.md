# PowerPoint Karaoke

## What is PowerPoint Karaoke?

PowerPoint Karaoke (also known as Battle Decks) is an improvisational activity where participants present slideshows they have never seen before. The presenter must make up a presentation on the spot based on random slides.

## Rules for PowerPoint Karaoke

1. Presenters don't see the slides until they begin their presentation
2. Each presenter gets approximately 3-5 minutes to present
3. Presenters must make up content on the spot, connecting the random slides into a coherent story
4. No preparation time is allowed
5. Embrace the randomness and have fun with it!
6. Audience can rate presentations based on creativity, humor, and how well slides were incorporated
